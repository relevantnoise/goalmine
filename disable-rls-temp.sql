-- TEMPORARY: Disable RLS to allow frontend database access
-- This allows goal editing to work while edge function deployment is fixed

-- Disable RLS on goals table (main issue)
ALTER TABLE goals DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Keep RLS enabled on other tables for security
-- ALTER TABLE motivation_history DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; 
-- ALTER TABLE subscribers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant permissions to anon role for goals (since authenticated role may not work with Firebase)
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON goals TO anon;

-- Note: This is a temporary fix. Proper solution is to fix edge function deployment
-- or create RLS policies compatible with Firebase auth.
