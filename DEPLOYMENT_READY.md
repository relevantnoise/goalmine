## üîÑ Development Workflow & Best Practices

### 1. Development Process
```
Local Development (localhost:5173)
    ‚Üì
Testing in Dev Environment
    ‚Üì
Commit to Git
    ‚Üì
Push to GitHub
    ‚Üì
Auto-Deploy to Vercel (both projects)
    ‚Üì
Production Testing on goalmine.ai
```

### 2. Development Best Practices

#### Always Work in Dev First
- Make ALL changes in local development environment
- Test thoroughly at localhost:5173
- Never edit production directly

#### Testing Protocol
1. **Before Committing**: Run full test suite locally
2. **Build Test**: `npm run build` must succeed without errors
3. **Manual Testing**: Complete the testing checklist below
4. **Commit with Clear Messages**: Describe what was fixed/added

#### Git Workflow (Branch-Based)
```bash
# Development
git checkout dev
git status && git add -A
git commit -m "Feature: [description]"
git push origin dev  # ‚Üí Safe staging deployment

# Production (when ready)
git checkout main
git merge dev
git push origin main  # ‚Üí Live production deployment
```

   - [ ] **BACKWARD COMPATIBLE**: All existing email-based goals continue working
   - [ ] **FORWARD COMPATIBLE**: New Firebase UID-based goals use proper architecture
   - [ ] **ARCHITECTURE**: Firebase auth provides unlimited scalability (no rate limits)

5. **Perfect Email System** ‚úÖ **AUTOMATION VERIFIED WORKING SEPT 16, 2025**
   - [ ] **ENVIRONMENT SEPARATION**: Only production (`goalmine.ai`) sends emails, dev environment blocked
   - [ ] **FREE TRIAL EMAILS**: Free trial users receive emails during valid 30-day trial period
   - [ ] Daily motivation emails sending automatically at 7 AM EDT (hybrid profile lookup implemented)
   - [ ] **HYBRID SUPPORT**: Email-based goals (danlynn@gmail.com) get emails via email lookup
   - [ ] **HYBRID SUPPORT**: Firebase UID goals (dandlynn@yahoo.com) get emails via ID lookup  
   - [ ] **AUTO-DETECTION**: System automatically detects goal type and uses correct lookup method
   - [ ] **NO DUPLICATES**: Users receive exactly 1 email per goal (not 2 from dev+prod environments)
   - [ ] **ALL USER TYPES**: Free trial, paid subscribers, email goals, Firebase UID goals all work
   - [ ] Nudge emails arrive (individual delivery via Resend)
   - [ ] Email verification works (via Firebase)
   - [ ] Password reset emails work (via Firebase)
   - [ ] Email templates render correctly with goal-specific content
   - [ ] Check-in links work from emails with user-specific parameters (`?checkin=true&user=email&goal=goalId`)
   - [ ] Users see helpful message if Firebase session expired from email links
   - [ ] **SECURITY**: Check-in links validate correct user using Firebase email, prevent cross-contamination
   - [ ] **SESSION SECURITY**: Wrong user on same device redirected to auth page (test with different email accounts)
   - [ ] **CUSTOM DOMAIN**: Emails sent from noreply@notifications.goalmine.ai (not resend.dev)
   - [ ] **BULLETPROOF**: Each user gets exactly 1 email per goal per day (atomic database updates)
   - [ ] **COMPREHENSIVE**: All user types receive emails regardless of account creation method
   - [ ] **UNIVERSAL**: Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, custom domains all supported via verified custom domain
   - [ ] **FIXED**: Subscription logic includes free trial users during valid trial
   - [ ] **FIXED**: Environment detection prevents dev environment from sending emails
   - [ ] **VERIFIED**: Custom domain notifications.goalmine.ai verified in Resend
   - [ ] **‚úÖ EMAIL TIMING FINAL RESOLUTION**: Pacific/Midway timezone solution implemented (Sept 22, 2025)
   - [ ] **‚úÖ BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY**: Date rollover triggering identified - emails trigger on timezone date change, not time
   - [ ] **‚úÖ PATTERN IDENTIFIED**: UTC rollover = 8 PM EDT emails, Eastern rollover = midnight EDT emails  
   - [ ] **‚úÖ BRILLIANT SOLUTION**: Pacific/Midway (UTC-11) midnight = 11:00 AM UTC = 7:00 AM EDT
   - [ ] **‚úÖ TIMEZONE FIX**: `todayDate` calculation changed to Pacific/Midway timezone in send-daily-emails
   - [ ] **‚úÖ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**: Lines 57-63 in send-daily-emails/index.ts updated with Pacific/Midway logic
   - [ ] **‚úÖ FUNCTION DEPLOYED**: Updated send-daily-emails function deployed and tested successfully
   - [ ] **‚úÖ DEBUG LOGGING**: Added UTC, Eastern, and Pacific/Midway date comparison for verification
   - [ ] **‚úÖ PERFECT TIMING**: Emails will now trigger at ~7:00 AM EDT when Pacific/Midway date rolls over
   - [ ] **‚úÖ DAILY-CRON FIXED**: Service role authentication issues resolved in daily-cron function (Sept 16, 2025)
   - [ ] **‚úÖ TIMING BUG FIXED**: Removed hourly restriction in send-daily-emails function (Sept 16, 2025)
   - [ ] **‚ö†Ô∏è ATOMIC FIX TESTING**: Check for duplicate emails - 4th attempt at fixing same issue (Sept 24, 2025)
   - [ ] **üö® REGRESSION MONITORING**: Verify users get exactly 1 email per goal, not 2 (Sept 25, 2025 test)

### Security Testing (Cross-Contamination Prevention)
1. **Email Link Security Test**
   - [ ] **Setup**: Have two user accounts (e.g., user1@gmail.com, user2@yahoo.com)
   - [ ] **Test 1**: Log in as User 1, click User 2's email link ‚Üí Should redirect to auth
   - [ ] **Test 2**: Log out completely, click User 2's email link ‚Üí Should go to User 2's dashboard
   - [ ] **Test 3**: Different browsers/devices ‚Üí Each user goes to correct dashboard directly
   - [ ] **Expected**: Email links only work for intended recipient (no cross-contamination)

2. **Session Persistence Security**
   - [ ] **Same Device/Browser**: Wrong user logged in ‚Üí Redirected to auth (secure)
   - [ ] **Same Device/Browser**: Correct user logged in ‚Üí Direct to dashboard (convenient)
   - [ ] **Different Devices**: Each user goes directly to their dashboard (seamless)

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Changes not appearing on goalmine.ai
**Solution**: 
1. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify GitHub push was successful

### Issue: "No Active Goals" flash on dashboard
**Solution**: 
- Ensure `authLoading` and `goalsLoading` are coordinated
- Check Dashboard.tsx loading logic

### Issue: Mixed user ID architecture causing ecosystem breaks ‚úÖ **RESOLVED WITH HYBRID SOLUTION SEPTEMBER 11, 2025**
**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ **HYBRID ARCHITECTURE**: Comprehensive solution supporting both email and Firebase UID formats
- ‚úÖ **BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: All existing email-based goals continue working without disruption
- ‚úÖ **FORWARD COMPATIBILITY**: New goals use Firebase UID for proper architecture consistency
- ‚úÖ **AUTO-DETECTION**: Functions intelligently detect goal format and adapt behavior accordingly
- ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE FIX**: All edge functions coordinate together (create-goal, fetch-user-goals, check-in, send-daily-emails)
- ‚úÖ **NO DATA LOSS**: dandlynn@yahoo.com's Firebase UID goal preserved during architectural transition
- ‚úÖ **ECOSYSTEM COORDINATION**: No breaking changes, all functions work together seamlessly

### Issue: Incremental fixes breaking downstream systems ‚úÖ **LESSON LEARNED SEPTEMBER 11, 2025**
**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSE**: Fixing individual functions without considering ecosystem-wide impacts
- ‚úÖ **LESSON**: Architectural changes require comprehensive planning to avoid cascade failures
- ‚úÖ **HYBRID APPROACH**: Simultaneous updates to all affected functions maintain ecosystem integrity
- ‚úÖ **TESTING**: Verified complete user flow works for both legacy and new architecture patterns

### Issue: Firebase authentication errors from email links
**Solution**:
- This is normal behavior when Firebase session expires
- App shows helpful blue alert message to user
- User logs in normally and continues to dashboard
- No action needed - UX enhancement handles this gracefully

### Issue: Subscription limits not working
**Solution**:
- Check Supabase `check-subscription` edge function
- Verify Stripe webhook is configured
- Test with real Stripe test keys

### üö® Issue: Email System Chronic Failures ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEW FAILURE MODE: ZERO EMAILS SENT (SEPTEMBER 26, 2025)**
**CRITICAL WARNING**: Email system has failed 5+ times with different failure modes despite multiple "final" fixes.
**Timeline**: Sept 14 (duplicates) ‚Üí Sept 23 (duplicates) ‚Üí Sept 24 (duplicates) ‚Üí Sept 26 (zero emails)
**ATTEMPTED FIX #5**: Success confirmation pattern (September 26, 2025)
**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ **LATEST FIX**: Only mark goals as processed AFTER successful email delivery via Resend
- ‚úÖ **TECHNICAL**: `if (emailResponse.error) { don't mark } else { mark processed }`
- ‚úÖ **LOGIC**: Failed emails remain unmarked for automatic retry tomorrow
- ‚úÖ **DEPLOYMENT**: Replaced send-daily-emails function (backup in send-daily-emails-backup/)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPECTATION**: Users should receive exactly 1 email per goal at 7 AM EDT
- üö® **PATTERN**: This is the 5th "tomorrow it will work" promise - confidence very low
- üö® **ARCHITECTURAL**: Dual project architecture remains the true root cause
- üö® **MANDATORY**: Extreme skepticism warranted - consider architectural migration as only real solution

### Issue: Users not receiving emails ‚úÖ **DIAGNOSED SEPTEMBER 11, 2025**
**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ **IDENTIFIED**: Resend requires email verification or domain verification for production
- ‚úÖ **TOOLS**: Use `test-resend-simple` function to test individual email addresses
- ‚úÖ **TOOLS**: Use `debug-email-issues` function for complete system diagnostics
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify users in Resend dashboard or set up domain verification

### üö® CRITICAL ISSUE: Database tables missing in production
**Symptoms**: 
- "relation does not exist" errors
- App not working at all
- Goals can't be created
- Subscription checks fail

**ROOT CAUSE**: Database migrations not applied to production

**SOLUTION (AI Assistant Only)**:
1. AI must immediately create and execute database setup function
2. AI must verify all core tables exist
3. AI must test app functionality
4. NEVER ask user to run SQL manually

**Prevention**: Always verify database schema before declaring deployment complete

## üîÑ Dev/Production Sync Process

### **NEW: Branch-Based Deployment (Your Son's Workflow - September 27, 2025):**
‚úÖ **Architecture**: True environment separation eliminates systematic bugs  
‚úÖ **Development**: dev branch ‚Üí steady-aim-coach project (NO cron jobs)  
‚úÖ **Production**: main branch ‚Üí GoalMine project (WITH cron jobs)  
‚úÖ **Safety**: Dev environment cannot affect live users

### **New Development Workflow:**
1. **Development work** (git checkout dev, localhost:5173)
2. **Push to staging** (git push origin dev ‚Üí steady-aim-coach.vercel.app)
3. **Test thoroughly** in safe staging environment
4. **Production deploy** (git checkout main, git merge dev, git push origin main)
5. **Verify production** (goalmine.ai)

### **Schema Sync Process:**
- **Dev Environment**: Uses local Supabase or shared dev instance
- **Production**: Uses production Supabase (dhlcycjnzwfnadmsptof)
- **AI Responsibility**: Ensure schemas match before deployment
- **Never Again**: User shouldn't need to run SQL manually
