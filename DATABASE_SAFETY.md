# üö® DATABASE SAFETY PROTOCOLS

## CRITICAL: Database Protection Rules (Updated October 3, 2025)

### üîí SAFETY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED
- **October 3, 2025**: Removed 62 dangerous edge functions including `cleanup-all-data`
- **October 3, 2025**: Disabled `cleanDatabase()` function in useGoals.tsx 
- **October 3, 2025**: Eliminated all bulk deletion and reset functions

### ‚ùå NEVER CREATE THESE FUNCTIONS
- Any function that deletes all records from a table (e.g., `cleanup-all-data`)
- Any function with `DELETE FROM table_name` without specific WHERE clauses
- Any function that deletes multiple users at once (e.g., `delete-user`, `delete-test-users`)
- Any "cleanup" or "reset" functions for production data
- Any function that truncates tables or drops data
- Any function with "emergency", "reset", or "clear" in the name affecting user data

### ‚úÖ ONLY SAFE DELETION PATTERNS
- Individual record deletion with specific ID: `.delete().eq('id', specificId)`
- User-specific deletion: `.delete().eq('user_id', userId).eq('id', recordId)`
- Always include user permission checks before deletion

## SAFE FUNCTION PATTERNS

### Individual Goal Deletion (SAFE)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ SAFE: User deleting their own goal
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('goals')
  .delete()
  .eq('id', goalId)
  .eq('user_id', userId); // CRITICAL: Must match user
```

### Individual Record Cleanup (SAFE)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ SAFE: Cleanup related records for specific goal
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('motivation_history')
  .delete()
  .eq('goal_id', goalId)
  .eq('user_id', userId); // CRITICAL: Must match user
```

## ‚ùå DANGEROUS PATTERNS TO NEVER USE

### Mass Deletion (DANGEROUS)
```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER: Deletes all goals for all users
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('goals')
  .delete()
  .neq('id', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');

// ‚ùå NEVER: Deletes all profiles
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .delete();
```

### Multiple User Deletion (DANGEROUS)
```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER: Deletes multiple users
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .delete()
  .in('email', ['user1@example.com', 'user2@example.com']);
```

## DEVELOPMENT SAFETY RULES

### 1. Function Naming
- NO functions with names like: `cleanup-*`, `delete-all-*`, `reset-database`, `clear-*`
- YES functions with names like: `delete-goal`, `remove-user-session`, `update-profile`

### 2. Required Safety Checks
Every deletion function MUST:
- Verify user authentication
- Check user permissions for the specific record
- Include user_id in WHERE clause
- Log the deletion with user context
- Never delete across multiple users

### 3. Code Review Requirements
ANY function containing `.delete()` must:
- Be reviewed for safety before deployment
- Include permission validation
- Have specific WHERE clauses (never blanket deletion)
- Be tested with mock data first

### 4. Emergency Prevention
- Remove service role keys from production if compromised
- Monitor edge function logs for mass deletion patterns
- Set up database activity monitoring
- Create point-in-time backup schedule

## CURSOR/CLAUDE CODE SAFETY

### For AI Assistants
When working with GoalMine.ai:
1. **NEVER** create functions that delete multiple records
2. **NEVER** call functions with "cleanup", "delete-all", or "reset" in the name
3. **ALWAYS** read function code before calling it
4. **ALWAYS** test on individual records first
5. **NEVER** use service role keys for mass operations

### Function Call Safety
Before calling ANY function:
1. Read the function code completely
2. Understand exactly what it deletes
3. Verify it only affects the intended user/record
4. Check for safety mechanisms and confirmations
5. Start with read-only operations to understand data

## PRODUCTION DATA PROTECTION

### Backup Strategy
- Enable point-in-time recovery on Supabase
- Regular automated backups
- Test restore procedures
- Document recovery processes

### Access Control
- Limit service role key usage
- Monitor database activity
- Alert on mass deletion operations
- Require explicit confirmation for any data deletion

### Development vs Production
- Use separate databases for development
- Never test deletion functions on production data
- Use mock data for testing dangerous operations
- Implement role-based access controls

## INCIDENT RESPONSE

### If Mass Deletion Occurs
1. Immediately revoke service role keys
2. Check for available backups or point-in-time recovery
3. Document what was deleted and when
4. Notify affected users if applicable
5. Implement additional safety measures

### Prevention Measures
1. Remove ALL dangerous cleanup functions
2. Implement confirmation mechanisms for deletions
3. Add database triggers to prevent mass deletions
4. Create read-only database roles for development
5. Monitor and alert on suspicious database activity

**REMEMBER: It's better to have a bug than to lose all user data. When in doubt, DON'T DELETE.**
