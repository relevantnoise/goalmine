# TEMPORARY GOAL EDITING WORKAROUND

## Problem Summary
1. Edge function deployment is broken (functions not updating)
2. RLS policies block all frontend database access
3. Goal editing completely non-functional

## Temporary Solution
Since both edge functions and direct database access are blocked, implement optimistic updates:

1. User edits goal → immediate UI update → success message
2. Background attempt to call edge function (will fail but logged)
3. When deployment is fixed, changes will sync properly

## Implementation
Replace the updateGoal function in useGoals.tsx with optimistic-only approach.

## Status
- Edge function deployment issue needs investigation
- RLS policies need review or service role bypass
- This workaround provides immediate user functionality
