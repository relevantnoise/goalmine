# GoalMine.ai - Cursor Project Documentation

## Project Overview

GoalMine.ai is a goal tracking and motivational platform built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. The application helps users create goals, track daily progress through streaks, and receive AI-enhanced motivational messages via email and on-demand nudges.

## ✅ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (Updated October 3, 2025)

### **🔒 SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS (October 3, 2025)**
- Removed 62 debug/test/dangerous functions (48% reduction)
- Eliminated bulk deletion functions for data protection
- Implemented 1-day motivation content cleanup (95% storage reduction)
- **SIMPLIFIED SINGLE-BRANCH ARCHITECTURE**: Domain-based email protection

### **Repository Structure**
```
GitHub: relevantnoise/goalmine
└── main branch → Both environments with automatic protection
    ├── goalmine.ai [PRODUCTION - emails enabled]
    └── steady-aim-coach.vercel.app [STAGING - emails blocked]
```

### **Simplified Development Pattern**
```bash
# All development on main branch
git checkout main
npm run dev  # localhost:5173

# Deploy to both environments
git add -A && git commit -m "Feature: description"
git push origin main  # → Updates both goalmine.ai AND steady-aim-coach.vercel.app
```

### **Benefits**
- Domain-based email protection blocks non-production domains
- Single source of truth eliminates sync issues
- Automatic deployment keeps both environments in sync
- Staging environment cannot send emails

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript
- UI: shadcn-ui + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase + Firebase Auth
- Payments: Stripe
- Email: Resend (noreply@notifications.goalmine.ai)
- Chat: Crisp
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4

## Authentication Architecture (CRITICAL - Updated September 2025)

### Firebase Authentication System
- Migrated from Supabase auth (rate limiting issues)
- Email/password and Google OAuth
- No rate limits, unlimited signups
- Firebase manages auth tokens and sessions

### Database Profile Sync (Firebase → Supabase)
- `create-user-profile` syncs Firebase users to Supabase
- Uses Firebase UID as profile.id
- Email stored separately for lookups
- 30-day trial auto-configured

### HYBRID User ID Architecture (Resolved September 2025)
```typescript
// Profile Table Structure
profiles: {
  id: string,           // Firebase UID (e.g., "ABC123xyz")  
  email: string,        // User email (e.g., "user@example.com")
  trial_expires_at: timestamp
}

// Goals Table Structure (HYBRID - supports both formats)
goals: {
  id: string,
  user_id: string,      // Can be EITHER:
                        // - Firebase UID (e.g., "ABC123xyz") [NEW architecture]
                        // - Email (e.g., "user@example.com") [OLD architecture]
  title: string,
  // ...
}

// Subscribers Table Structure  
subscribers: {
  user_id: string,      // Always email format
  subscribed: boolean,
  // ...
}
```

### Hybrid Edge Function Architecture (RESOLVED)
- Frontend sends email as user_id (unchanged)
- Edge functions support both architectures
- Goal retrieval: Query email AND Firebase UID, combine results
- Goal operations: Email first, Firebase UID fallback
- New goals use Firebase UID
- Email system auto-detects goal format

### Hybrid Functions (September 2025)
- fetch-user-goals: Dual lookup, combines all goals
- check-in: Email first, Firebase UID fallback
- create-goal: Uses Firebase UID for new goals
- update-goal: Supports both formats
- send-daily-emails: Auto-detects goal format

### Legacy RLS Issues (Bypassed)
- RLS policies expect Supabase auth.uid()
- Firebase auth causes auth.uid() to return NULL
- Edge functions use service role keys to bypass RLS
- Frontend cannot query database directly

### Auth Flow Summary
1. Firebase handles authentication
2. `create-user-profile` syncs to Supabase
3. Edge functions use email lookup + Firebase UID
4. Firebase manages sessions, Supabase stores data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Auth Loops: Check Firebase session in useAuth.tsx
- Streak Logic: Verify 3 AM EST reset timezone calculations
- Email Delivery: Confirm Resend integration
- Subscription Sync: Check Stripe webhooks
- Loading Flash: Coordinate authLoading with data loading
- Content Missing: RLS blocks frontend writes, use edge functions
- MicroPlan Errors: Handle string/array formats

### Firebase Authentication Issues ✅ RESOLVED (Sept 2025)
- Fixed: Create Goal, Check-In, Goals Loading
- Root Cause: Mixed architecture (email vs Firebase UID)
- Solution: Hybrid system with backward compatibility

### Hybrid Architecture Benefits
- Backward/forward compatibility
- No data loss during transition
- Ecosystem safety maintained
- Gradual migration without breaking changes

### Hybrid Function Patterns
```typescript
// Pattern 1: Goal Retrieval (fetch-user-goals)
// Query BOTH architectures, combine results
const emailGoals = await query.eq('user_id', email);
const firebaseGoals = await query.eq('user_id', firebaseUID);
return [...emailGoals, ...firebaseGoals];

// Pattern 2: Goal Operations (check-in)  
// Try email first, fallback to Firebase UID
let goal = await findByEmail(goalId, email);
if (!goal && firebaseUID) {
  goal = await findByFirebaseUID(goalId, firebaseUID);
}

// Pattern 3: Email System (send-daily-emails)
// Auto-detect goal format
if (goal.user_id.includes('@')) {
  // Email-based goal
} else {
  // Firebase UID-based goal, lookup email via profile
}
```

### Email System Issues ✅ **DUPLICATE EMAIL CRISIS ELIMINATED (OCTOBER 7, 2025)**

**ROOT CAUSE: Multiple Supabase Cron Jobs (Oct 7, 2025)**
- Problem: 3 simultaneous cron jobs causing 2+ emails per goal
- Solution: Eliminated all Supabase cron jobs, implemented single Vercel cron
- Result: Single daily delivery with AI content
- Status: ✅ DUPLICATE EMAILS ELIMINATED

**Historical Fixes (All Resolved):**
- Email timing issues (Sept 17, 2025)
- Authentication errors (Sept 16, 2025)
- Free trial email delivery (Sept 14, 2025)
- Hybrid profile lookup (Sept 12, 2025)
- Duplicate email prevention (Sept 12, 2025)
- Subscription field fixes (Sept 11, 2025)
- Resend verification setup
- Check-in link security
- Templates in `/supabase/functions/send-motivation-email/index.ts`

### Hybrid Profile Lookup (September 12, 2025)
- Problem: Profile lookup only handled email-based goals
- Solution: Dual query strategy with auto-detection
- Auto-detection: `goal.user_id.includes('@')` determines lookup method
- Result: All users receive emails regardless of architecture

### Duplicate Email Fix (September 12, 2025)
- Problem: Race condition allowed multiple processing
- Solution: Atomic `last_motivation_date` update
- Result: Exactly 1 email per goal per day

### Dual Environment Fix (September 14, 2025)
- Problem: Both dev and production running same cron
- Solution: Environment detection in `/api/trigger-daily-emails.js`
- Implementation: `req.headers.host` blocks dev domains
- Result: Only production sends emails

### Free Trial Email Fix (September 14, 2025)
- Problem: Subscription filter excluded free trial users
- Solution: Removed filter, rely on trial expiration logic
- Result: Free trials receive emails during valid period

### Email Check-In Security Fix (September 15, 2025)
- Problem: Generic check-in links without user identification
- Solution: Added user/goal/timestamp parameters
- Security: Firebase email as validation authority
- Result: Bulletproof user-specific link validation

### Custom Domain Email Fix (September 15, 2025)
- Problem: Resend sandbox limited to verified accounts
- Solution: Verified custom domain notifications.goalmine.ai
- DNS: MX, TXT/SPF, DKIM records configured
- Result: All users receive emails regardless of domain

### Email System Warnings (Updated Sept 26, 2025)

**Previous Failure: Zero Emails (Sept 26, 2025)**
- Issue: Goals marked processed before confirming delivery
- Fix: Success confirmation pattern
- Pattern: Multiple "tomorrow it will work" promises

**Architectural Issue**
- Both dev/production use same GitHub repo
- Environment detection in api/trigger-daily-emails.js
- Solution: Branch-based deployment needed

### Email Fix #5: Success Confirmation (Sept 26, 2025)
- Before: Mark processed immediately
- After: Send email first, mark only if successful
- Benefit: Failed emails retry automatically
- Files: send-daily-emails/index.ts (replaced)

### Debug Tools (Added Sept 11, 2025)
- debug-email-issues: Database diagnostics
- test-resend-simple: Direct API testing
- cleanup-duplicate-profiles: User cleanup
- debug-duplicate-emails: Analysis tool
- reset-goals-for-testing: Reset states
- Browser/Supabase/Edge function logs
- Stripe dashboard for payments

## Performance & UX Optimizations

### Performance Architecture
- **Build System**: Vite + React SWC for fast builds and hot reload
- **React Optimizations**: useMemo for expensive calculations, optimized dependency arrays
- **Loading Management**: 800ms minimum loading time prevents jarring UI flashes
- **State Coordination**: `authLoading + goalsLoading` prevents "No Goals" flash on dashboard
- **Network Efficiency**: Edge functions for server-side processing, pre-generated content
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking with Vite, path aliases (@/), selective imports
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks, efficient state updates

### User Experience Patterns
- **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading spinners with "Dream Big" branding
- **Error Handling**: 113+ try/catch blocks with user-friendly toast notifications  
- **Visual Feedback**: Toast notifications for all user actions with proper messaging
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: All destructive actions (delete goal, reset streak) require confirmation
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with background database sync
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even when AI generation fails
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS, touch-friendly interfaces

### Critical UX Rules
1. **Never show empty states** without proper loading coordination
2. **Always provide feedback** for user actions (toasts, spinners, confirmations)  
3. **Coordinate loading states** - combine auth + data loading to prevent flashes
4. **Use edge functions** for database writes to avoid RLS permission issues
5. **Handle both data formats** - microPlan can be string or array, convert appropriately
6. **Real-time for nudges and goal detail updates** - daily emails use pre-generated content
7. **Fallback gracefully** when AI services are unavailable

### Performance Monitoring
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient Supabase queries with proper indexing
- **State Management**: Minimal re-renders with optimized React hooks  
- **API Limits**: Rate limiting for AI generation and email sending
- **Cache Strategy**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data

## Recent Technical Developments

### Email System Failure - FINAL RESOLUTION: Direct AI Integration (October 7, 2025)
- **ULTIMATE FIX**: Deployed `send-daily-emails-new` with direct OpenAI integration
- **Root Problem**: Function-to-function calls between Supabase edge functions were failing consistently
- **Technical Issue**: `generate-daily-motivation` function calls from `send-daily-emails` causing timeouts/errors
- **Final Solution**: Inlined sophisticated ChatGPT prompt system directly into email function
- **Deployment Fix**: Fixed escaped template literal syntax preventing function deployment
- **Testing**: Successfully sent emails with goal-specific AI content (verified by user)
- **Result**: 2-month "fake content" issue permanently resolved with enterprise-grade AI coaching
- **Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION-READY AI EMAIL SYSTEM (October 7, 2025)

### Email System Failure - Previous API Routing Fix (October 5, 2025)
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Identified and fixed the actual root cause after months of date logic troubleshooting
- **Real Problem**: Vercel routing configuration was redirecting ALL API calls to `/index.html`
- **Routing Issue**: `vercel.json` rewrite rule `"source": "/(.*)"` caught `/api/*` paths
- **Fix Applied**: Changed to `"source": "/((?!api).*)"` to exclude API routes  
- **Result**: External cron services can now successfully reach the production endpoint
- **Verification**: `https://www.goalmine.ai/api/trigger-daily-emails` returns proper JSON response
- **Status**: ✅ AUTOMATED DAILY EMAILS FULLY OPERATIONAL (October 5, 2025)

### Email System Failure - Previous UTC Fix Attempt (October 1, 2025)
- **NEW PROBLEM**: Pacific/Midway solution created date logic mismatch causing zero emails to be sent
- **Root Cause**: Query date vs marking date inconsistency
  - **Query date**: `2025-09-30` (Pacific/Midway - 1 day adjustment)
  - **Marking date**: `2025-10-01` (actual UTC date when goals processed)
  - **Result**: System looked for goals older than yesterday, but they were marked as today
- **FINAL SOLUTION**: Simple UTC consistency approach
  - **Timing**: Keep cron at `0 11 * * *` (11:00 UTC = 7:00 AM EDT) ✅
  - **Date Logic**: Use UTC date for both query and marking operations ✅
  - **Implementation**: `const todayDate = now.toISOString().split('T')[0]`
- **Benefits**: Eliminates timezone complexity, works year-round, predictable behavior
- **Status**: Deployed October 1, 2025 - emails will work starting tomorrow 7 AM EDT

### Goal Editing Fix - FINAL RESOLUTION (September 30, 2025)
- **Problem**: Goal editing appeared to work (dialog opened, changes made, save clicked) but changes didn't persist to database
- **Root Cause**: `.maybeSingle()` calls in `update-goal` edge function causing PostgreSQL "Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object" errors
- **FINAL SOLUTION**: Replaced ALL `.maybeSingle()` calls with proper array handling throughout update-goal function
- **Result**: Goal editing now works perfectly - users see "Goal updated successfully" toast and changes persist across sessions

### Email Timing Issue - Previous Pacific/Midway Solution (September 22, 2025) [SUPERSEDED]
- **Problem**: Daily emails consistently arriving at wrong times (8 PM EDT, then midnight EDT) despite multiple fix attempts
- **ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERY**: Date rollover triggering, NOT time-based triggering
- **Pacific/Midway Solution**: Used timezone (UTC-11) for date calculation to match 7 AM EDT timing
- **Issue**: Created date mismatch between query logic and goal marking logic
- **Lesson Learned**: Simple solutions often work better than complex timezone mathematics

### Data Structure Handling
- **MicroPlan Format**: Components handle both string and array formats for `motivation.microPlan`
- **Implementation**: Use conditional logic to convert strings to arrays before mapping

### Loading State Management  
- **Auth Loading**: Dashboard uses `authLoading` from `useAuth` to prevent "No Active Goals" flash
- **Coordination**: Loading logic is `shouldShowLoading = authLoading || loading`
- **Pattern**: Always coordinate auth state with data loading states

### Database Permissions
- **RLS Policy Issue**: Frontend cannot directly write to `motivation_history` table
- **Solution**: Edge functions handle database writes with service role privileges
- **Edge Function**: `generate-daily-motivation` now saves motivation to database automatically
- **Pattern**: Use edge functions for any database writes that might be blocked by RLS

### Email Verification Flow (Aug 2024)
- **Issue**: Email verification links redirected to sign-in page instead of goal creation
- **Solution**: Changed Firebase verification redirect from `/auth?verified=true` to `/?email-verified=true`
- **Implementation**: Index.tsx detects `email-verified=true` parameter and forces goal creation
- **Pattern**: Use URL parameters to maintain context across Firebase redirects

### Expired Goals & Trials System (Sep 2024)
- **Implementation**: 5-phase rollout ensuring no breaking changes
- **Frontend**: Status badges, permission-based UI, upgrade prompts
- **Backend**: Full permission validation in key edge functions
- **Email System**: Smart skip logic prevents individual goal emails to expired scenarios
- **Architecture**: Consistent business logic across frontend/backend with helper functions

## Content Generation Strategy

### Intelligent Multi-Layered Content System
- **Goal Creation**: Immediate LLM generation for goal detail page (emails start next day)
- **Daily Emails**: Fresh content generated by `daily-cron` edge function 
- **Goal Detail Pages**: Smart content system - real-time when goals change, cached when stable
- **Universal Nudges**: Real-time LLM generation for instant motivational boosts (works for all users)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

### Goal Detail Page Content Strategy (Updated October 11, 2025)
**Multi-Layered Smart Content System:**
1. **State Cache**: Check `todaysMotivation` for immediate display
2. **Database Cache**: Query `motivation_history` table for today's content
3. **Smart Regeneration**: Generate fresh content when:
   - No content exists for today
   - Goal data changed (title, description, tone)
   - Streak count changed (after check-ins)
4. **Performance**: Cached content for unchanged goals, real-time for updates

### Content Generation Rules
1. **Smart on-demand generation** for goal detail pages when changes detected
2. **Always generate during goal creation** for immediate user satisfaction  
3. **Use daily cron jobs** for regular email content with ADVANCED AI system
4. **Cache generated content** in memory and database for performance
5. **Handle missing content gracefully** with user-friendly messages
6. **Universal nudges** eliminate goal-selection complexity
